\label{structactuator_config_data}\index{actuatorConfigData@{actuatorConfigData}}


Structure for actuator configuation data. It contains the time (in miliseconds) that passed from the last time the actuator was configured with play pattern (needed for wait\+Time preconfiguration) and the latest used actuators patttern slot. Actuator driver can have limited number of pattern slots that can be hold in the memory. Each driver slots are played one by one when the \char`\"{}go\char`\"{} pin is triggered.
