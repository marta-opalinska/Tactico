# Introduction

**Tactico** is a hardware independent C++  framework for **haptic device setup and control**. It can be used with different types of actuators. Currently the framework  supports LRA and ERM motors, but the modular architecture makes a new hardware integration easy. The control module can be wired or wireless depending on your preference. 

## Currently Supported Hardware

**Actuators**: Linear Resonant Actuator (LRA), Eccentric Rotating Mass (ERM)

**Tested Boards**: Arduino Nano 33 BLE, nRF52840

**Actuator’s Drivers**: DRV2605LEVM-MD, Pulse-Width modulation (PWM)
